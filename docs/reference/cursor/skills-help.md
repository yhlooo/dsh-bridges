# Skills

Skills are reusable sets of instructions that teach Agent how to handle specific tasks. They're more detailed than rules and designed for multi-step workflows.

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that teach Agent specialized workflows. For example, deploying an app to staging or running a security audit across your dependencies. They're reusable across conversations and shareable across your team.

## How do I create a skill?

Type `/create-skill` in chat and describe the skill you want. Cursor comes with a built-in skill that walks you through naming, structuring, and saving a new skill.

To create one manually, add a `SKILL.md` file in `.cursor/skills/your-skill-name/`:

```md
# Deploy to staging

1. Run the test suite
2. Build the production bundle
3. Deploy to the staging environment
4. Verify the deployment health check
```

You can also organize skills into subfolders, like `.cursor/skills/shipping/deploy-staging/SKILL.md`. Cursor walks the skills root recursively, so category folders work for grouping related skills. The skill's name comes from the folder that contains `SKILL.md`, not the category above it.

Skills are automatically loaded from `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/` (global), and `~/.cursor/skills/` (global), including nested project subdirectories such as `apps/web/.cursor/skills/` in a monorepo. Skills in a nested project directory are automatically scoped to files inside that directory — for example, skills under `apps/web/.cursor/skills/` are only surfaced when the agent works with files in `apps/web/`, similar to the [`paths` frontmatter field](https://cursor.com/help/customization/skills.md#how-do-i-scope-a-skill-to-specific-files). For compatibility, Cursor also loads skills from Claude and Codex directories: `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, and `~/.codex/skills/`.

## How do I scope a skill to specific files?

Add a `paths` field to the skill's frontmatter. The skill only applies when the agent works with files that match:

```md
---
name: react-component-patterns
description: Conventions for writing React components.
paths:
  - "**/*.tsx"
---

# React component patterns

...
```

`paths` accepts a list or a comma-separated string of glob patterns. Leave it unset for a skill that should be available regardless of which files are open. See the [Skills reference](https://cursor.com/docs/skills.md) for the full frontmatter schema.

## How do I use a skill?

Type `/` followed by the skill name in chat to run it (e.g., `/write-tests`), or type `@` and select it to attach as context. Agent reads the skill file and follows the instructions.

## When should I use skills instead of rules?

|                 | Rules                                                   | Skills                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Short coding guidelines and constraints                 | Multi-step workflows and procedures                   |
| **Length**      | A few lines to a few hundred lines                      | Often longer, with detailed step-by-step instructions |
| **How applied** | Included as context in every (or matching) conversation | Invoked on demand with `/skill-name` or `@skill-name` |
| **Example**     | "Use TypeScript for all new files"                      | "Deploy to staging: run tests, build, deploy, verify" |

Use a rule when a short instruction is enough. Use a skill when Agent needs a detailed, repeatable process to follow.

## How do I convert a rule into a skill?

1. Type `/create-skill` in chat and tell Agent to turn your rule into a new skill (e.g., "turn `@my-rule` into a skill")
2. Review the generated skill file
3. Delete the original rule file if you no longer need it

## How do I migrate commands to skills?

Type `/migrate-to-skills` in Agent chat. This built-in skill (available in Cursor 2.4+) identifies eligible rules and commands and converts them to skills automatically.

It converts:

- **Dynamic rules**: Rules with `alwaysApply: false` (or undefined) and no `globs` patterns.
- **Slash commands**: Both user-level and workspace-level commands, preserving their explicit invocation behavior.

Rules with `alwaysApply: true` or specific `globs` patterns are not migrated, as they have explicit triggering conditions that differ from skill behavior. User rules are also not migrated since they are not stored on the file system.
